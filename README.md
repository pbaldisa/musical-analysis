# musical-analysis
This project aims at using statistics and a vast amount of data to find if physical attributes of a song make it popular. We will create a model to predict the next hit, if we find there is a correlation between success and the features selected. 

We are currently populating a relational database using MySQL and we will use Python to build a model and test our hypothesis.
